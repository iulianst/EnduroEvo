## Garmin Watch Face 
### Currently running on Fenix 6

I wrote this code some time ago in a weekend because I could not find the features I needed on other watch faces.
Recently I fixed some errors, added some new features and I decided to make it public so other people could benefit form this work.
It is currently stable on my watch as far as I tested it.
The code needs to be cleaned up and made extensible. Some features needs to be added and some existing features reworked.
It needs to be tested on other watches as well, so if you decide to fork this and run it on your watch pleas let me know how it goes.
